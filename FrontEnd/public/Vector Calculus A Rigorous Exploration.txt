Okay, I understand. Here's a comprehensive vector calculus course design, keeping in mind the specified depth (5), learning style (Read/Write), and the user's "big brained" preference (implying a desire for rigor and deep understanding).

## Resources

Given the "Read/Write" learning style and preference for depth ("Big brained"), I'll focus on resources that facilitate active learning through reading, writing, and rigorous understanding:

**General Textbooks:**

1.  **Div, Grad, Curl, and All That: An Informal Text on Vector Calculus (H.M. Schey):** A classic, intuitive approach. Good for building conceptual understanding.

2.  **Vector Calculus (Jerrold E. Marsden and Anthony J. Tromba):** A more comprehensive and rigorous text, suitable for a strong math background.
    *   [Amazon Link to Book](https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Calculus-6th-Jerrold-Marsden/dp/1429215089)

3.  **Calculus (James Stewart):** A popular calculus textbook that includes a thorough treatment of vector calculus.  Excellent for review of prerequisites.

**Online Lecture Notes & Courses (Read/Write Focused):**

4.  **MIT OpenCourseWare - Multivariable Calculus (Professor Dennis Auroux):** While technically multivariable, it builds a strong foundation for vector calculus. The lecture notes and problem sets are excellent.
    *   [MIT OCW Link](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-02-multivariable-calculus-fall-2007/) (Look for "Lecture Notes" and "Assignments")

5.  **Paul's Online Math Notes - Vector Calculus:** Clear and concise explanations with numerous examples. Excellent for quick reference and self-study.
    *   [Paul's Notes Link](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcIII/CalcIII.aspx)

**Practice Problems & Worked Solutions:**

6.  **Schaum's Outline of Vector Analysis (Murray R. Spiegel):** A classic collection of solved problems. Excellent for practicing techniques and building problem-solving skills.

**Strategy for the "Big Brained" Learner (Read/Write):**

*   **Active Reading:** Don't just passively read the material. Take notes, summarize concepts in your own words, and work through examples step-by-step.
*   **Proof-Oriented Approach:**  Try to understand the *why* behind each formula and theorem. Look for proofs in the textbooks and online resources.  Attempt to reconstruct the proofs yourself.
*   **Problem-Solving Focus:** The best way to learn vector calculus is to *do* vector calculus. Work through a large number of problems of varying difficulty.
*   **Write Your Own Notes:**  Create a comprehensive set of notes that summarize the key concepts, formulas, and techniques. This is especially effective for Read/Write learners.
*   **Teach Others:** Explaining the material to someone else is a great way to solidify your understanding.

This course structure and these resources should provide a solid foundation in vector calculus for a motivated learner who prefers reading and writing as their primary learning style. The emphasis on rigor and depth should satisfy the "big brained" preference. Remember to actively engage with the material, practice consistently, and seek out additional resources as needed. Good luck!
